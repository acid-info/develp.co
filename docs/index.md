# Devlop

## Description

Nimbus applied to become a node operator in Lido for Ethereum in wave 5. Instead of applying as Nimbus or Status, we applied under a new but related, recently established entity called Develp GmbH per advise from our legal team. 

We have now been shortlisted and this shortlist has gone to a vote to the Lido DAO. 

They know that **"Develp" is associated with Nimbus** and is representing Nimbus hence we got priority in amongst 114 other applications. We are now in the shortlisted 7 out of the 114 applicants. 

The DAO vote will conclude end of the week but is already clear that it will go through. Lido are now wanting to accelerate the onboarding process for Develp and have asked for a ‘logo’ for the organisation and a website/Twitter handle. 

Given the org is Develp (and we want to keep it separate to Status/Nimbus) we need to create and supply them with a logo for Develp.
